This is IN-CSE platform that will be running, along with the Node JS server, on the Infrastructure Node host.
Let's keep in mind we four parts for the whole project : the Sensors, the Middle Node, the Infrastructure Node and the User Web Application.
Here we focus on the Infrastructure Node part and more specifically on the IN-CSE platform.

WARNING : THIS IS THE FIRST PART YOU NEED TO RUN BEFORE ALL THE OTHER PARTS ! 
		(EVEN BEFORE THE NODE JS SERVER)
	YOU HAVE TO RUN THE NODE JS SERVER AND THIS IN-CSE ON THE SAME HOST TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR TESTS
